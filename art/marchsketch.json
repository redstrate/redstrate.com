Fiona from Haunting Ground, looking around and gripping her left arm. A TV screen with Gustavo from Pizza Tower looking down at the drawings below, and a rat sits behind him. A woman with orange-brownish hair is looking at the viewer with her arms crossed. The same woman looking annoyed at the viewer. The same Viera from before, but this time in battle clothes and laying on a bed? Then finally a woman with pink hair, wearing a badly drawn maid outfit and holding a badly drawn broom to match.",
