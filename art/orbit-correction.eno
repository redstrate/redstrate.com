Two rocket boosters, currently firing at full thrust. The ship is trying to avoid orbital collision.

This is something a bit different from what I usually do, which is a rocket! Technically, it's really just two giant boosters.
Based off of the same one in the Rebuild of Evangelion 3.0 opening, which is probably one of my favorite sequences (ever).
