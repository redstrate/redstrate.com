Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet! My username is **redstrate** and I'm a software engineer, KDE developer and artist. I like Linux, taking apart stuff, and spending way too much time curating this site. This website doubles as my portfolio and dumping ground for the things I work on.

* Want to read? Check out my [blog posts]({{< ref "blog" >}}).
* Interested in [my drawings]({{< ref "art" >}})? I also do some [music]({{< ref "music" >}}), but not seriously.
* I have a list of the [software I made and maintain]({{< ref "software" >}}) here too!
* I also have a [PeerTube](https://tube.ryne.moe/@redchannel) and a [Owncast](https://owncast.online/) for my videos and livestreams respectively.

Please consider signing the [guestbook]({{< ref "guestbook" >}}) too. For other cool websites, check out the [outgoing links]({{< ref "links" >}}) p!
