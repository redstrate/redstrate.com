Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet! I'm a KDE developer but also an artist, and I enjoy
working with Qt, C++, Rust, etc. This website is my portfolio, but also my blog and dumping
ground for cool stuff I'm working on.

I make [blog posts sometimes]({{< ref "blog" >}}). You an find more of [my art here]({{< ref "art" >}}). If you like my website, consider signing the [guestbook]({{< ref "guestbook" >}})!
