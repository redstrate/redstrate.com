Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet! My username is **redstrate** and I'm a software engineer, KDE developer and artist. I like Linux, taking apart stuff, and also taking care of my website. This place functions as both my portfolio and dumping ground for the things I like to work on.

* Check out my [blog posts]({{< ref "blog" >}}) for Linux, KDE, and technical discussion.
* I also have given some [talks at conferences]({{< ref "talks" >}}).
* If you're into art, I have a gallery of [my drawings]({{< ref "art" >}})! I also do some [music]({{< ref "music" >}}), but not often.
* I have an exhaustive list of the [software I've made and maintained]({{< ref "software" >}}).

Please consider signing the [guestbook]({{< ref "guestbook" >}}) if you pass through here. For cool websites and mutuals, check out my [outgoing links]({{< ref "links" >}})!
