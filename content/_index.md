Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet! My username is **redstrate** and I'm a software engineer, KDE developer and artist. I like Linux, taking apart stuff, and spending too much time curating this site. This website functions as my portfolio and dumping ground for the things I work on.

* Check out my [blog posts]({{< ref "blog" >}}) for Linux, KDE, and technical talks.
* If you're into art, I have a gallery of [my drawings]({{< ref "art" >}})! I also do some [music]({{< ref "music" >}}), but not often.
* I have an exhaustive list of the [software I've made and maintained]({{< ref "software" >}}).
* I also have a [PeerTube](https://tube.ryne.moe/@redchannel) and a [Owncast](https://stream.redstrate.com/) for my videos and livestreams respectively.

Please consider signing the [guestbook]({{< ref "guestbook" >}}). For cool websites and mutuals, check out the [outgoing links]({{< ref "links" >}})!
