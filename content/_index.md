Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet! My username is **redstrate** and I'm a software engineer, KDE developer and artist. I like Linux, retro crud and curating my site. My website is also my portfolio, blog and dumping ground for cool stuff I'm working on or find.

* Interested in my drawings? Check out my [art gallery]({{< ref "art" >}}). I also do some [music]({{< ref "music" >}}).
* Maybe my [software]({{< ref "software" >}}) is useful to you?
* I also have a [PeerTube](https://tube.ryne.moe/@redchannel) and a [Owncast](https://owncast.online/) for my videos and livestreams.
