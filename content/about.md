{{< profile-picture >}}

I'm known online as **redstrate**, and I create things to fill my own niche. I program, draw, and occasionally make bad music and edit videos. I'm a contributor to open source projects, and also a KDE developer. In my free time, I like to cook and study languages (real world and programming ones!) Of course, also play way too many video games!

I like developing software that I would personally use, and it also fills a niche or problem that either isn't adequately solved, or maybe just want to learn how to do it myself. My languages of choice usually are [C](/software/tags/c), [C++](/software/tags/cplusplus), and [Rust](/software/tags/rust) - and that's what you'll find most of the projects using!

Drawing has been a hobby of mine ever since childhood, and I try to draw when I can. I have a showcase of almost all of the art I've made since 2016 in [my gallery]({{< ref "art" >}}). I'm not a professional artist so my posting schedule tends to be erratic. My preferred software is [Krita](https://krita.org) and [Blender](https://blender.org). I also like to animate, but I don't really get the chance to sit down and do it anymore.

I also like to administrate my own servers, and that's what's hosting the website you're reading right now! You can find more details about this setup below.
