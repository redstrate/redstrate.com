### Info

Hello! I'm known as _"redstrate"_! I tend to create things to fill my own niches, and like to learn by doing. This website
is not only my personal corner of the Internet, but also the archive of everything that I created :-)

I primarily speak English, but currently learning Japanese. My progress so far: completed learning ひりがな and かたかな,
and moving onto basic grammar and counting (hence why the rest of this sentence is still in english...)

### Machines

| Name     | Operating System |
|----------|------------------|
| Adrastea | Gentoo Linux     |
| Amalthea | macOS            |
| Rhea     | Gentoo Linux     |

As you can probably tell, I like working with Linux, and using alternative operating systems in general. My preferred desktop environment is
KDE and I enjoy using both Gentoo and Arch Linux.

### Software

The primary reason why I develop software is that I find a niche or a problem that either isn't adequately solved, or
want to learn how to do it myself. I don't like developing software just to "develop" it, like mindlessly following a trend
or a tutorial. 

I like working in [C](/tags/c), [C++](/tags/c++), and [Rust](/tags/rust) - and that's what you'll find most of the projects using!

###  Art

Drawing has been a hobby of mine ever since childhood, and I still try to draw when I can. My preferred software is Krita
(FOSS FTW) when I'm at home, and Procreate on the go. In very rare cases, I'll even stream some of my art process on
Picarto!
