**note** You can find my resume [here]({{< ref "resume" >}}).

Hello! I'm known as "redstrate" and I'm a programmer, artist and other things. I like creating [software](/software), 
drawing [art](/art), making [music](/music) and more. You can find all the stuff I created on this site!

I like working with Linux, and using alternative operating systems in general. My preferred desktop environment is
KDE and I enjoy both Gentoo Linux and Arch Linux. You can find my dotfiles repository here.

When it comes to software development, I usually choose C, C++ or Rust with maybe some Go or Python in there. I enjoy
creating graphical software, but I'm also experienced with web development and some reverse engineering.

Art has been a hobby of mine ever since childhood, and I still try to draw when I can. My preferred software is Krita
(FOSS FTW) when I'm at home, and Procreate on the go. In very rare cases, I'll even stream some of my art process on
Picarto!
