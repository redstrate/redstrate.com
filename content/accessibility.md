I strive to make my website as accessible as possible, conforming to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). If you find a portion of my website that does not conform or could use some touch up, do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact).

## Known Issues

These are issues I know of, and working towards fixing.

* Currently not all images on my website have proper alternative text, like on my blog.
