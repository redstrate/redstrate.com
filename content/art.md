Here is my gallery, a collection of artwork that I have created.  I try to include some of my old art here as well,
which I've kept since 2016. Some of these may be NSFW, but I leave that up to your discretion - the thumbnails should
make it plenty obvious.

My current two programs are Krita and Procreate, depending on what I'm drawing on. I used CSP momentarily, so only a
few pieces were made exclusively in that program (like "eva girls")
