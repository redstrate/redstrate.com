I heard about nomadsculpt so I wanted to try it tonight!
I don’t really have any sculpting experience, and this is my second attempt at making a human face. I think it turned out pretty good though (but that’s mostly because I chose the angle hehe)
This is really good for portable sculpting and well thought out. I miss some of Blender’s tools, but it has a lot. Its also not subscription based.
