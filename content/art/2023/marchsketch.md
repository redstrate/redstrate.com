alt_text: "From top left to bottom right: Viera (bunny girl) looking at the viewer. Peppino from Pizza Tower opening a food container, annoyed to find a small rat inside. Fiona from Haunting Ground, looking around and gripping her left arm. A TV screen with Gustavo from Pizza Tower looking down at the drawings below, and a rat sits behind him. A woman with orange-brownish hair is looking at the viewer with her arms crossed. The same woman looking annoyed at the viewer. The same Viera from before, but this time in battle clothes and laying on a bed? Then finally a woman with pink hair, wearing a badly drawn maid outfit and holding a badly drawn broom to match."

Here's a collection of sketches I finally finished! I didn't feel like doing a full piece, so I opted to color each of these instead.

I also finished Haunting Ground recently, so of course I had to draw Fiona. I wonder if someday Capcom would remake this game (and hopefully not change around things too much!) Pizza Tower is also awesome, I love Gustavo and his Dumb Rat.

More of my Viera in here too, mostly unused sketches.
