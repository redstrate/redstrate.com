Jake the dog going through a doggy door, holding a key. A slime. Multiple small cheese people and a big cheese head yelling. The same woman but in two different poses, one looking at the viewer and another one which looks like sheâ€™s complaining."

Ended off the month with another page of sketches! Been watching a lot of Adventure Time recently, and I guess I never really drawn any of their characters before (and yes, that's Tiffany and the Angry Squirrel in the window!)

I also threw in some old Mysterious Swordswoman sketches I had lying around that I liked and colored them.
