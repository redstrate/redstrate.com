alt_text: "Drawing of a woman staring up at the moon, which is casting a low light across the grass field. She has her right hand resting on her head, and the other on her side. She's wearing a dark jacket, a greenish top and some sweatpants. There's a few ladybugs flying around the numerous foliage."
