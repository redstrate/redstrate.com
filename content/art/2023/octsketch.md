However he stopped and is now judging you for watching him do it.A tiny chat smiley from Twitch, and a Vinesauce mushroom looking at it.Some sleeping mouth monster, with cartoonish sleeping Z's.A young girl in a school outfit, turning a lever.The same mouth monster from before, but now yelling with it's mouth wide open!A cute small, chibi bunny with a very large heart. There are two arrows pointing at it, saying &quot;Not mine&quot; and &quot;Who?&quot;Mario giving you a thumbs up.Doodle Bop from Spongebob is trying to erase Kirby, which is a play on Kirby's Adventure where it teaches you how to draw kirby.The mouth monster again, but laughing and looking to the left.Mari Makinami from Rebuild of Evangelion, turned away to the side but looking at you still."
