  alt_text: Comic strip made up of four panels. The first panel has one girl putting up a poster on the side of a store wall. Another woman is walking nearby, but the other says 'Huh?' and 'Ma'am! Please wait!' The second panel has the first girl asking 'Would you please try on something for me?' while looking amazed. The other girl asks the following in the next two panels, as the first holds up her hands to imagine a picture. 'Well I dunno, is it gaudy?' 'I'm not exactly the fancy-type' and finally, 'I don't have any money.' The first woman replies 'I just need someone to try it on. That's all!'

  alt_text: Two panels make up this comic. The first bubble sets up that it's 'Some time later...' The other woman is now clothed in a one-piece dark bunny suit, with long white gloves. The other girl is behind her, with a measurement tape. She asks 'See? Isn't it cute? ‚ù§Ô∏é' and the other respons 'Sure, but it barely fits me.' 'Really? I'm sure I fit it correctly.' In the next panel, the woman in the bunnysuit is eating a carrot. She says 'A carrot too? It's pretty dry.' Off-panel, the other girl says 'Ma'am, that's for decoration...' In the last panel it's a drawing of a door, specifically the bell above it ringing as it swings open.
