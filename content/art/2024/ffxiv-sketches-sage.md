alt_text: "Drawing of a Sage from Final Fantasy XIV, which happens to be a female Viera with short hair tied in a ponytail. She's dressed in a white robe (although the entire picture is black & white) with long sleeves, and a sash tied around her waist. Complete with a complete, she's holding her elbow and she's healing or something."
