alt_text: "The mysterious swordswoman, clad in Mai Shiranui's outfit. Well, one of many because she has like seven different iterations.It's some kind of scantily clad dress, with a short flap in front and a really loose top tied in the back. She is also wearing... uh... some kind of towel? And there's  large bead laying on the ground attached to her."
