alt_text: "A robot named Y2K is walking through a really dingy and dark hallway. They are comprimised of six arms, three heads (one is not visible in this image.) They are currently holding an optical disk in one hand and a floppy drive in another. The first screened face is green and is making a sad winking face. The second monitor on top is sleeping."
