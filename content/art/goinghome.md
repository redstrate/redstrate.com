A painting of a road split by a two track railway crossing. there are numerous power lines, cables and road signs littering the roadside. there is a sidewalk visible in part of the frame, but no one is on it. there are visible cars and non-descript buildings in the distance.

## Commentary

My last painting of 2022 (I think). Based on a real photo :-)
