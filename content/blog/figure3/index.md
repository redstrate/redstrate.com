It's time for another figure review, this time with Ryza!
<!--more-->
Funnily enough, this figure actually convinced me to try Atelier Ryza (1) again, which runs great on the Steam Deck thanks
to the atelier-sync-fix created by doujistin, who created DXVK. Games aside, here's the figure.

The figure is around average price ($150) and was already released by the time I got around to purchasing it.
After ordering it from AmiAmi, the figure arrived in about 3-4 days via DHL, so pretty nice shopping experience
from AmiAmi.

The packaging is clear, and plastic - sort of reminds me of Pop-up Parades. Not that it's cheap,
it has a nice photo on the back, and a nice background. After taking her out, you have to do.. assemble it:

Yes, for some reason all the bits on the bottom are seperated. I'm no figure maker, but it's
really strange that they were removable in the first place. I guess if someone doesn't want them on the figure sure, but
they're small enough in the first place, and _they still have imprints on the sand_, I'm just really
confused why they weren't just glued on. Anyway, the figure itself:

The figure is really well sculpted, and I like the material _a lot_. It's of those weirdly
textured PVCs they like to use in more expensive figures, that feels like it's _soft_ almost, but it's clearly just plastic.
Just like other figures of this caliber, they take some liberties in the proportions of Ryza, namely making her more "human sized" and
making her head less large, which makes her body look bigger. I kind of wish Ryza looked like this in the second game, which is _supposed_ to be 3
years after the first one, yet it just looks like she's in a different out. Curiously Ryza 3 fixes this issue, but that's only
a timegap of a year. Yeah, that's confusing.

I almost forgot to mention the base, which looks really nice and the additions on the bottom
are much appreciated to break up the beach texture.
