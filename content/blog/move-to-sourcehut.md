Recently I've moved pretty much all of my repositories over to sourcehut! <!--more--> This is a huge change, as I haven't changed my primary code hosting provider, Github, since 2-3 years ago.

**Edit:** There is a follow up to my sourcehut migration located [here]({{<ref "moving-to-sourcehut-followup">}})!

You'll notice all of the site's links now point to sourcehut repositories, and there should be no more
broken links (sorry!) Also, my Github is not going away, since I still like to contribute to
Github projects. So, I decided to keep hosting mirrors of my projects there and I'm still accepting PRs as well -
but if possible the issues/todos and the wikis are moving to sourcehut as well. You can see a good example for
[astra](https://sr.ht/~redstrate/astra).
