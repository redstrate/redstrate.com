Over the past few hours I did some serious cleaning up on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/redstrate), I basically removed every single original repository I had. <!--more--> I still need GitHub in order to contribute to some projects, so my forks are kept. For people trying to find my missing repositories, I added a profile README to direct people to my sourcehut instead.

There were many reasons why I ditched GitHub, a couple are detailed below:
* I disliked the “social media” features that were just getting more and more prominent. I didn’t really care for these and I just saw it as introducing bloat and spam to the platform (cue small PRs just for a one line README change just to get a contribution award).
* [GitHub Copilot](https://drewdevault.com/2022/06/23/Copilot-GPL-washing.html). Enough said.
* GitHub is not [free software](https://drewdevault.com/2022/03/29/free-software-free-infrastructure.html).
* Complexity in working, (this is my own fault) but having three remotes to worry about was getting in my way.

I will also be retiring [git.ryne.moe](https://git.ryne.moe/) (as a code archive) in order to reduce friction while working. I plan on making changes, so I can have it pull my changes on sourcehut automatically, but that will come later. If you're wondering why did I choose sourcehut over my own GitLab, it's mostly because I don't want to lose everything due to my own incompetence ;-)
