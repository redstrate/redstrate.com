I think this has been a pretty productive year for me. I wrote 38 blog posts, created 40 artworks, and over 500 merge/pull requests!

I hate describing my own achievements, but I felt like I really did a lot this year. I have noticed a drastic improvement in my artwork, my programming and my mood. I finally traveled outside of my country, and met some nice people! There's probably some other accomplishments I forgot, but I think you get the point.

And a large chunk of my free time has been contributed towards [KDE](https://kde.org) and the surrounding community, which has been an incredible learning experience. Thank you to everyone who has tolerated me, while I make stupid mistakes. (I foresee owing a lot of beers üòÖ) I was extremely fortunate to visit Akademy this year[^1], which I'm hoping to do next year too! I hope my presence has been a positive one, and I don't plan on slowing down anytime soon.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the people who helped me along (you know who you are!) Thank you to the people who enjoy the software I maintain and the artwork I create. So... thank you for reading! Danke! „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ!

See you next year.
