A couple of years ago at my previous job, my manager pulled me aside one day to ask to do something. He was worried about one of the other employees, specifically about how I treated her. (It also happened to be his sister!) It wasn't anything bad, no - but a suggestion. He asked me to start saying "thank you" more. It seems kinda ridiculous looking back at it, what a weird reason to pull someone aside for, right?

... but it makes sense! I didn't give thanks often, and she took it as I didn't appreciate her work at all - which really hurt. Of course that wasn't my intention, but I didn't realize that the small appreciations really go a long way. I think it's better that something is said even if it might seem frivolous. You don't know how much it might mean to someone!

When someone accomplished something beneficial for you - even if you're both getting paid to do it - I think it's still helpful to thank them. Ever since then I've been trying to thank people to the best of my ability. Even if things turn sour, it's important to treat people with respect. I think this is even more important in online environments, where intentions and interactions are easily misinterpreted. A "thank you" goes a long way and helps people not feel ignored, even if that wasn't your intention.

Now you know why I say "thank you" a lot! I hope this might convince you rethink when you say it too. So... thank you for reading! Danke! ありがとう! Now back to my regular technical posts and status updates.
