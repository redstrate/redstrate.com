I think this has been a pretty productive year for me. I wrote 38 blog posts, created 40 artworks, and over 500 merge requests!

A large chunk of my free time has been contributed towards [KDE](https://kde.org) or the surrounding community, which has been an incredible learning experience. Thank you to everyone who has tolerated me, while I make my stupid mistakes (and I will be owing a lot of beers) üòÖ I was extremely fortunate to visit Akademy this year[^1], which I'm hoping to do next year! I hope my presence has been a net positive one, and I don't plan on slowing down anytime soon.

I felt like I've grown a lot as a person this year too, thanks

So... thank you for reading! Danke! „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ! See you next year.

[^1]: Maybe by Akademy 2024 I'll finally be done sitting on my 2023 post...
