The easiest and fastest way you can contact me is e-mail via josh@redstrate.com.

Other services that support direct messaging:
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@redstrate) as `@redstrate@mastodon.art`
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/@redstrate@pyra.sh#/@redstrate:pyra.sh) as `@redstrate:pyra.sh`

## Privacy

I run my own e-mail server, but I don't sign my e-mails (yet). If you require encryption from both sides, Matrix is another option since it supports end-to-end encryption.
