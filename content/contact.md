title: "Contact"

The easiest and fastest way to contact me for personal matters is e-mail me via josh@redstrate.com.

Other services that support direct messaging:
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@redstrate) as `@redstrate@mastodon.art`
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/@redstrate@pyra.sh#/@redstrate:pyra.sh) as `@redstrate:pyra.sh`

## Privacy

I run my own e-mail server, but I don't sign my e-mails with my GPG key. If you require encryption from both sides, Matrix is the preferred option since it supports end-to-end encryption.
