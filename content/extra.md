## Gentoo Overlay

This is my personal Gentoo overlay that I use on my Gentoo computers. It contains ebuilds for some of my software, but
also some ebuilds I wrote myself for certain third-party software. You can find it [here](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/ebuilds).

## Arch Linux Repository

I host my own Arch Linux repository called elysium at https://pkgs.pyra.sh. The database and all packages are GPG signed
with the key located at https://pkgs.pyra.sh/key.txt which you must import with pacman-key first.

You can find some of the original PKGBUILDs [here](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/pkgbuilds).

## Guestbook

I have a guestbook you can sign if you like this website. Check it out [here](/guestbook)!
