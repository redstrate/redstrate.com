## Gentoo Overlay

This is my personal Gentoo overlay that I use on my Gentoo computers. It contains ebuilds for some of my software, but
also some ebuilds I wrote myself for certain third-party software. You can find it here.

## Arch Linux Repository

I host my own Arch Linux repository called elysium at https://pkgs.pyra.sh. The database and all packages are GPG signed
with the key located at https://pkgs.pyra.sh/key.txt which you must import with pacman-key first.
