If you want to follow me, I suggest using an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) reader above all else (yes, even Mastodon.) These feeds allow you to recieve updates as fast as your reader can fetch them, and I'm wholly in control of my feed with no other middlemen. You don't need an account to follow RSS feeds either, unlike following me on a social media site.

* Blog ([RSS](/blog/index.xml), [HTML](/blog)): Linux, KDE, and technical discussion
* Art ([RSS](/art/index.xml), [HTML](/art)): My new artwork!
* Videos ([RSS](https://tube.ryne.moe/feeds/videos.xml?videoChannelId=3), [HTML](https://tube.ryne.moe/@redchannel)): Any videos I post on my PeerTube
* Mastodon ([RSS](https://mastodon.art/@redstrate.rss), [HTML](https://mastodon.art/@redstrate)): Mostly nonsense, posts about the same things as the other feeds
