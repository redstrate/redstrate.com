I have a full-time job, so I'm not hurting for money. If you still wish to donate or tip me for something I did, that's still appreciated! If you wish to receive something in return, I'm [open for art commissions](/commission).

I am not an independent contractor, and cannot directly accept money in return for specific software tasks.

# Ko-Fi

[Ko-Fi is preferred](https://ko-fi.com/redstrate) because it's easy, and they take no processing fees. You can even set a little comment to go along with your donation!

# PayPal

You can use [PayPal directly](https://paypal.me/redstrate) if Ko-fi doesn't work for you.
