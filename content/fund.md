title: "Fund"

I'm in between work - _not related to my own projects or hobbies_ - and school. I'm always balancing between what I do in my
free time, but donations help me do the stuff I want and possibly the things you enjoy! As always, **donations are never required but appreciated**.

If you wish to recieve something material in return for your money, I'm [open for art commissions!](/commission)

## Ko-Fi

[Ko-Fi is preferred](https://ko-fi.com/redstrat) because it's easy, and they take no processing fees. You can even set a little comment to go
along with your donation!

## PayPal

You can use [PayPal directly](https://paypal.me/redstrate) too if you want to!
