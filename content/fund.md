title: "Fund"
---

I'm balancing between what the projects I do in my free time, but donations can help fund possible hardware costs and a tip is always appreciated.

If you wish to instead receive something material in return, I'm [open for art commissions](/commission)!

# Ko-Fi

[Ko-Fi is preferred](https://ko-fi.com/redstrate) because it's easy, and they take no processing fees. You can even set a little comment to go along with your donation!

# PayPal

You can use [PayPal directly](https://paypal.me/redstrate) too if you want to!
