### This Website and Related Services

Connections to my websites may be checked for abuse, but nothing is permanently logged nor do I care to log you.

### Silica Viewer

Silica Viewer _does not_ collect any information about your device, and doesn't contact any server. The app has no networking functionality and runs inside the secure macOS sandbox. The only analytics collected are those which Apple collects and I
cannot turn off, such as when you report a crash.
