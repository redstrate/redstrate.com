# This Website and Related Services

Connections to my server may be logged for abuse, but I do not care to track you.

This website may involve connections to first-party services (they are hosted by me.) These may include:
* The content of the website, which is hosted on redstrate.com. I don't hotlink often (maybe the odd image in an embedded social media post). I also employ cross-origin policies to prevent leakages. The website source code is [available here](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/redstrate.com) and the NGINX configuration simply serves it from a directory on the server.
* The comments system, which is hosted under comments.redstrate.com. If the page you view has comments enabled, it may make requests if you have Javascript enabled. I run an [unmodified Isso instance](https://isso-comments.de/).
* The voting system, which is hosted under voting.redstrate.com. If the page you view has voting enabled, it may make requests if you have Javascript enabled. The source code for this system is [available here](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/voting-system).

Links to external websites are clearly marked with an external link icon, although it sometimes will mark domains that are actually hosted by me.

I do not use any analytics services.

# Silica Viewer

Silica Viewer _does not_ collect any information about your device, and doesn't contact any server. The app has no networking functionality and runs inside the secure macOS sandbox. The only analytics collected are those which Apple collects and I
cannot turn off, such as when you report a crash.
