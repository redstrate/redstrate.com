### This Website and Related Services

My website may run analytics. For transparency, the analytics software is [umami](https://github.com/mikecao/umami). This is a privacy-friendly, open source analytics software that is running on _my server_ and hosted on _a domain I control_, unlike other software like Google Analytics which are collected by advertising companies. The analytics are completely anonymous, and I have no way to tell who visited the page. The JavaScript is blocked automatically if you have Do-Not-Track enabled, or can easily be blocked using your preferred wide-spectrum blocker. In the future, these analytics may be publicized, but are still anonymous.

Analytics do not run on my Onion services.

Connections to my websites may be checked for abuse, but nothing is permanently logged nor do I care to log you.

### Silica Viewer

Silica Viewer _does not_ collect any information about your device, and doesn't contact any server. The app has no networking functionality and runs inside the secure macOS sandbox. The only analytics collected are those which Apple collects and I
cannot turn off, such as when you report a crash.
