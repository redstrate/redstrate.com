During the day I like to program, and at night I... also like to program. If you're reading this page you probably want to know what I'm up to!

I like working with Qt, C++ but also branching out into Rust and tiny bits of web development (like this website). My primary operating system is
Linux, so making sure things build and run across different operating systems is an interesting challenge. I love working with graphics APIs,
like Vulkan and OpenGL.
