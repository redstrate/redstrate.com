summary: "Mastodon to Twitter cross-poster!"
---

This is one of my first Go and Twitter projects, and I used to use on @redstrate. This tool is defunct since I no longer use Twitter.

A simple Mastodon to Twitter poster. I use this for my art-only Twitter account, which only filters the art that I post. There is currently no cross poster built for this in mind as far as i'm aware. By default, it only cross posts where a "#art" tag is found, but this is configurable. If your attachments are marked as sensitive, this is translated to Twitter as well!

This is my own Go and Twitter hobby project and shouldn't be considered for any level of production use. For example, your password and secrets are kept in plaintext, so please use this on a system you trust.
