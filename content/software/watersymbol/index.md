Fire Emblem clone for a course final project.

<!--more-->
---

A Fire Emblem clone using libGDX and Java. This is for a course final project, and it features stuff like:

* Proper A* navigation for enemies, and is also player unit pathing.
* All the assets are wholly created by me, except for the default Arial font included in libGDX.
* Working gameplay loop, allowing you to kill or be killed by the enemy units on a test map.
* Maps can be created in Tiled, allowing for easy authoring.
