    "alt_text": "Drawing of Merume, a four armed succubus. The drawing has no color, and is just lines. She is holding a Canon L1, which has two grips (yes, really.) She's also adjusting the huge interchangable lens, and holding some of her bangs back so she can look in the viewfinder. She's also wearing a really big T-Shirt.",
