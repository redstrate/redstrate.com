    "alt_text": "A poster for The Chromosomes, a fictional ArtFight band. It consists of four colored and energetic members.\n\nWe have D4c (the youngest) in blue, and the lead vocalist. He's holding a microphone and very happy to see you.\n\nNext there's Jean (the older brother of Foo) and he's on lead guitar. He's also jamming out on the mic.\n\nBehind those two is Foo himself, younger brother of Jean. He's a bit quiet, but looks like he's enjoying himself and his bass guitar.\n\nFinally - in the back - is Akira the drummer. He's having a blast while drumming away with his sticks.\n\nThe text on the poster (from top to bottom) says The Chromosomes, Featuring D4c, Jean, Foo and Akira, LIVE TONIGHT @ 9 PM, DNA ARENA, Produced by @boogiewoogie.",
