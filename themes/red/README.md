# Red Theme

The theme I use for my website is technically reusable, but it's custom built for my website.

Here is a list of variables you should set in your `config.html`:
* `author`, `description`: This is put into various metadata.
* `github_username`, `invent_username`, `gitlab_username`: Used to the resolve the correct user in the software contributions list.
* `isso_url`: For the isso-based comment system.
* `geekring_site_id`: For the geekring widget.
* `profile_picture`: Used in the title.
* `fediverse_url`: Used to set the Fediverse creator tag.
* `image_host`: Where the images are hosted for the gallery.
* `kofi_username`: For the Ko-Fi widget.
